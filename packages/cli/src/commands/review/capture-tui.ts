// `qwen review capture-tui`: run a command in a throwaway terminal and hand
// back what it actually rendered — the evidence producer for rendering claims.
//
// A verifier ruling on "the panel clips at 80 columns" without this command
// reads the layout code and imagines a terminal; measured on this repo, the
// imagining is where rendering verdicts go wrong. This command makes the
// terminal real and the evidence a file:
//
//   tmux (PRIVATE server, -L)  →  .ans (pane text with escapes, always)
//                              →  .png (freeze-rendered, when available)
//
// The safety property is isolation, and it is structural: every tmux call is
// scoped to a per-run private server socket, so the capture cannot see —
// let alone resize or kill — the user's own tmux sessions. The measured
// failure mode of desktop-automation verification was exactly "drives the
// user's own windows"; a private server makes that impossible rather than
// discouraged. `kill-server` at the end reaps everything the capture started.
//
// Degradation is explicit, not silent: the manifest names which evidence rung
// was reached (`png` or `ans-only`) and why, because a verifier must say
// which rung its verdict stands on — a PNG is publishable rendering evidence,
// an .ans proves bytes but not pixels, and prose is neither. A REFUSED
// capture writes no manifest at all — the bottom rung (`none`) is reported by
// the refusal JSON on stdout instead, so a missing manifest reads as a
// refusal, not corruption.
