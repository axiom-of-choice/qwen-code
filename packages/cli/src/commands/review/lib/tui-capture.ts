// now, read the layout code and imagined the terminal. Phase 1 gave findings a
// place to carry image evidence (`assetFiles` → `publish-assets`); this file
// and its command are Phase 2's producer: drive the TUI in a throwaway tmux,
// capture what it actually rendered, and hand back files a finding can carry.
//
// Everything here is pure so the naming, geometry and ladder rules are
// unit-testable without tmux, freeze, or a filesystem. The command layer owns
// the processes.

  //
  // TWO nested shells, not one: in a single shell, a command ending in

  // before the capture (measured: deterministic "no server running" refusal
  // on `printf ...; exit 0`). The inner sh absorbs the exit; the outer one
  // holds the pane.
  //
  // The outer holder ALSO survives SIGINT: non-interactive shells stay in
  // the pane's foreground process group, so one C-c — a canonical --keys
  // token — delivers INTR to the holder itself and would take pane →
  // session → server down before the capture (measured). `trap : INT`, NOT

  // C-c for targets without their own handler, while a trapped signal
  // resets to default in children — the command keeps its normal Ctrl-C
  // behavior, and only the holder is protected.
  //
  // The hold sits on its OWN LINE: appended with `;` it is voided by the

  // already. EVERY trailing `;` is escaped, including one already preceded
  // by a backslash: tmux CONSUMES that backslash (measured: the token

  // running sleep; the trap runs and a single-sleep script would simply
  // end — pane, session and server gone (measured 5/5). The loop re-enters
  // sleep and the pane survives. The loop is BOUNDED — 180 periods of one
  // minute — so an unreaped holder (SIGKILL'd harness, OOM) self-terminates
  // after three hours instead of living indefinitely. The WATCHDOG carries
  // that same cap for the other half of the lifetime: the loop only starts
  // once the captured command has exited, so a command that keeps running
  // (a TUI — the normal case) left the cap unreachable and an orphaned
  // server lived on. `kill -9 -$$` takes the whole pane process group, and
  // tmux tears the pane, session and server down behind it (probe-verified
  // with a still-running command: `no server running` right after the
  // watchdog fired). `$$` is the holder's pid inside the subshell — a
  // subshell does not change it — and the holder is its group leader. It
  // IGNORES INT and QUIT, and must: an async subshell in a non-interactive
  // shell already ignores them per POSIX, so a `--keys C-c` killed only its
  // `sleep` and it ran straight into the kill — measured end to end with
  // bash 5.2 as /bin/sh, ONE C-c took pane, session and server down and the
  // capture refused `no server running` with zero artifacts, while the same
  // run with this trap captured its marker. (dash does not reproduce it, so
  // a dash-only probe would have missed it.) `trap ''` is SIG_IGN and
  // inherits across exec, but nothing here execs anything but `sleep`, so
  // the captured command keeps its own Ctrl-C behaviour. MANY SHORT periods,
  // not a few long ones: each post-exit signal consumes the period it
  // interrupts, so with three hour-long sleeps the three C-c tokens this
  // command explicitly supports exhausted the whole budget MID-CAPTURE —
  // pane, session and server gone before capture-pane ran, refusing
  // `tmux failed mid-capture: no server running` (measured 5/5 on
  // `--keys C-c C-c C-c`) and blaming tmux for the holder's own budget.
  // A minute per period keeps the same three-hour cap while making a
  // keypress cost a minute of it.
  // NO outer `sh -c` wrapper: the same invocation pins default-shell to
  // /bin/sh, so tmux's direct child — the pane's session leader — runs this
  // script ITSELF, and the trap lives at layer 0. Wrapped, the trap sat one
  // layer deep: INT survived via the outer shell's wait-and-cooperate
